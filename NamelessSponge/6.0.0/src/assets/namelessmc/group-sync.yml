# Nameless Plugin configuration

# permissions have to be set the following way:
# you need to check the groups' ids in your NamelessMC web setup
# and here you have to set the permissions like the example
# down here. If the player has a permission which has been set
# down here, then the group in which the permission is set will
# be applied to the player if it's registered in the web. 

permissions:
  # If the player has 'custom.permission', their group will be set to 0
  0: "custom.permission"
