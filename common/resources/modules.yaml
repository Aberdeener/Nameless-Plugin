# Supported platforms: all
# Run commands sent by the Websend module (third party)
# For this to work you must also configure the server id in the 'server-data-sender' section. However, websend
# is unrelated to the server data sender and the server data sender doesn't have to be enabled.
websend:
  # Poll the Websend module for commands to execute
  command-executor:
    enabled: false
    interval: PT5S
  # EXPERIMENTAL (for real, don't use this): Send console output to the Websend module
  console-capture:
    enabled: false
    interval: PT2S
